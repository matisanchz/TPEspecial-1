    <h3>WELCOME to MOLLUSCA</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of this Mollusc Catalog is to exhibit a wide range of molluscs, helping malacologist classifying their species by classes and subclasses.</p>

  <p> Malacology is the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species after the arthropods. </p>
  
  <p> Molluscs include snails and slugs, clams, and cephalopods, along with numerous other kinds, many of which have shells. One division of malacology, conchology, is devoted to the study of mollusc shells. </p>

  <p> Fields within malacological research include taxonomy, ecology and evolution. Applied malacology studies medical, veterinary, and agricultural applications; for example, molluscs as vectors of disease, as in schistosomiasis. </p>
  
  <p> Archaeology employs malacology to understand the evolution of the climate, the biota of the area, and the usage of the site. </p>
  
  <p> In 1681, Filippo Bonanni wrote the first book ever published that was solely about seashells, the shells of marine mollusks. </p>

        <strong> </strong> Living molluscs are usually grouped into eight classes: Gastropoda (see gastropod), Bivalvia or Pelecypoda (see bivalve), Cephalopoda (see cephalopod), Scaphopoda (tusk shells), Aplacophora (Solenogasters), Caudofoveata (sometimes included in the Aplacophora order), Polyplacophora (chitons), and Monoplacophora.

        Around 85,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized. The number of fossil species is estimated between 60,000 and 100,000 additional species. The proportion of undescribed species is very high. Many taxa remain poorly studied.
